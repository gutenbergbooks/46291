<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">NATURE&rsquo;S WONDERLAND</span></h2>
<p>Truly, Yellowstone National Park is a wonderland
of nature. Poets have written about it, and
artists have painted it, but to believe that such a
scenic region is possible, you must see with your
own eyes the spouting geysers, bubbling cauldrons,
giant canyons and other spectacular phenomena,
all of which present a flashing brilliance
of motion and color which you will never forget.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="Morning Glory Pool" width="500" height="351" />
<p class="center"><i>Morning Glory Pool</i></p>
</div>
<p>Yellowstone is the largest, the oldest and, perhaps,
the best known of America&rsquo;s many national
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
parks. It is at once weird, incredible and magnificent
in its rugged, wild beauty. It is one of
the greatest wild-life sanctuaries in the world.</p>
<p>Frontiersman John Colter discovered the fabulous
area by chance in the winter of 1807-08.
Colter had been sent by the celebrated trader,
Manuel Lisa, to Pierre&rsquo;s Hole in eastern Idaho to
make friends with the Crow Indians. Coming
home Colter sought a short cut and stumbled
upon the mystery of Yellowstone. When he told
his friends of the fantastic land he had seen, they
refused to believe him.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="John Colter discovers Yellowstone" width="500" height="176" />
</div>
<p>Twenty years later Jim Bridger brought back
a report similar to Colter&rsquo;s, but he, too, was
greeted with winks and smiles. Finally, however,
the Washburn-Doane Expedition, headed
by H. D. Washburn, Surveyor-General of Montana,
was organized in August 1870, and accompanied
by an army detail, officially investigated
the phenomena in the Park.</p>
<p>They encountered innumerable fascinating
wonders that even Colter, Bridger and other explorers
had missed. They were determined that
Yellowstone should be preserved in all its primeval
beauty for the enjoyment of all Americans.
Their enthusiasm was boundless. Largely because
of their efforts a bill was passed through
Congress on March 1, 1872, and the rugged wilderness
was set aside as Yellowstone National
Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>Since that time millions of travelers
have seen the glory that is
Yellowstone&rsquo;s. Thousands return
year after year. Still others come
only once, but they consider it the
trip of a lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">GRAND TETON</span></h2>
<p>A few miles south of Yellowstone
is Grand Teton National Park, set
aside by the government in 1929.
Grand Teton and the surrounding
country have many distinctive features.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="Jackson Lake and the Tetons" width="500" height="354" />
<p class="center"><i>Jackson Lake and the Tetons</i></p>
</div>
<p>Grand Teton is noted for its
mountain grandeur. Many of its
jagged, towering peaks of granite
rear their heads upward 10 to 13
thousand or more feet. In many
respects they resemble the famed
Alps of Europe.</p>
<p>Lying at the base of these towering
spires are lakes of sapphire-blue,
and round about are forests and
verdant meadowlands.</p>
<p>Here the visitor feels the tang of
the Old West. Central lodges and
sleeping cabins are available. Safe
saddle trails reach out in all directions.</p>
<p>Motorboats and rowboats as well
as trusty saddle ponies may be rented
at nominal charges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br /><span class="small">SEEING YELLOWSTONE PARK</span></h2>
<p>You may see Yellowstone National
Park in your own way. Roam
the trails alone, or with an experienced
guide, as you prefer. But, by
all means, bring your camera!</p>
<p>Yellowstone is <i>your</i> park! It has
been provided with fine roads and
modern hotels so that you may enjoy
its wonders in comfort. You are
genuinely welcome to come and stay
as long as you like. You could easily
stay all summer and never exhaust
the alluring appeal, the charm, and
tonic effect of Yellowstone&rsquo;s beauty.
However, if you can stay for only a
limited period, you can still see all
the principal points of interest.</p>
<p>You can live as modestly or as lavishly
as your choice dictates. In traveling
about the Park you may select
the style of accommodations that
appeals most to you. You can go
by Park motor bus with other visitors,
or by yourself in a private automobile.
Such automobiles are
available for hire at government-approved
rates.</p>
<p>Splendid camping sites may be
found in all parts of the Park. At
the main centers of interest are
modern hotels, as well as clean, comfortable
cabins. Service and accommodations
are excellent and one
cannot help but marvel at such comfort
and luxury in the depths of the
wilderness.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>So that visitors may see as much
of the Park as possible, in a limited
amount of time, pre-arranged tours
by motor bus are operated. These
tours are especially appreciated by
folks who travel by rail to Yellowstone.
The tour consumes just two
and one-half days. Leisure stops
are made to properly see all the
chief scenic attractions. Another advantage
of selecting a pre-arranged
tour is that it eliminates the anxiety
of driving your own car over unfamiliar
mountain roads. Without
stress and strain, completely relaxed,
you&rsquo;re all the more free to enjoy
Yellowstone&rsquo;s wondrous sights.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Modern Yellowstone bus leaving Old Faithful Inn" width="500" height="611" />
<p class="center"><i>Modern Yellowstone bus leaving Old Faithful Inn</i></p>
</div>
<p>Bus drivers in Yellowstone Park
are thoroughly competent and reliable.
Also, Ranger Naturalists of
the National Park Service provide
many enlightening bits of information
on the formations, the flora
and fauna in their talks and on
guided walks.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><br /><span class="small">WEST YELLOWSTONE ENTRANCE</span></h2>
<p>The Union Pacific route to Yellowstone
National Park takes visitors
to West Yellowstone, Montana,
right on the Park border, and the
nearest entrance to Old Faithful
Geyser, Yellowstone&rsquo;s most famous
attraction. Here, amid the fragrance
of the pine forests, the railroad
maintains West Yellowstone Station,
and an attractive dining lodge.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the station you
have a short time for refreshments;
a brief glimpse of the rustic village;
mailing cards; buying souvenirs,
or perhaps making a few necessary
purchases. Then you&rsquo;re ready to
climb into a comfortable motor bus
for the trip to Old Faithful region.</p>
<p>The first day&rsquo;s ride is a preview
of the promise that Yellowstone will
fulfill. Along the way you will be
constantly amazed by a continuous
series of pulse-quickening sights ...
green, virgin forests; National Park
Mountain; glimpses of the Madison
River, and charming views of distant
mountains.</p>
<p>Presently the chatter of the cascades
of Firehole River is heard.
This is one of Yellowstone&rsquo;s most
bewitching waterfalls. Oddly
enough, while the waters are
warmed from geysers and hot
springs, the river is alive with trout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br /><span class="small">FIRST VIEW OF THE GEYSERS</span></h2>
<p>In the Lower Geyser Basin, Yellowstone
parts the curtain and
stages a gigantic thermal exhibit.
Here the first geysers come into
view. There they are! Dipping and
skyrocketing; spears of boiling water
belch upward, dazzling white
against the backdrop of blue skies
and forest greenery. For size, number,
power and action, no other
geysers in the world compare to
those of Yellowstone.</p>
<p>In the west and south-central
parts of the Park are six major geyser
basins. Each contains a number
of geysers, pools and springs. This
spectacular section of Yellowstone
is extremely fascinating. In the
Lower Basin are numerous well-known
geysers, but in the Upper
Basin famous Old Faithful probably
will attract your first attention.
Moreover, near by is Old Faithful
Inn, where you will want to stay for
one or more delightful, pleasure-filled
days.</p>
<p>Park Ranger Naturalists have
prepared an interesting display at
Old Faithful which reveals the intricate
operation of geysers. An artificial
miniature geyser has been
constructed and its working parts
may be seen and understood. In
reality a geyser is a hot spring that
has developed into a fountain. A
plume of water shoots upward at
nearly boiling temperature. The
hot volcanic rocks beneath the earth
create steam and give the geyser
force. At Yellowstone the subterranean
action is near the earth&rsquo;s
surface and the geysers act as safety
valves in draining off this excess
energy.</p>

<p>Most famous of all geysers is Old
Faithful. It is everything you would
expect to see in a geyser. Old Faithful
has the showman&rsquo;s touch, as well.
With a rumbling fanfare and roll of
drums beneath the thin shell of the
earth, Old Faithful goes into action.
Then a hissing, boiling pillar of
water spurts into the air. Rapidly
it gains momentum until it reaches
a height of 140 feet or more.</p>
<p>For four minutes it continues to
play, and then gradually dies away.
Tiny wisps of steam linger a moment,
and then disappear. Old
Faithful puts on its show within a
few minutes of a specified time. The
average interval between eruptions
is 65 minutes.</p>
<p>It is staggering to conceive just
how much water Old Faithful hurls
skyward during each of its extraordinary
performances. It has been
estimated, however, that in a single
day this geyser discharges approximately
250,000 gallons of water.</p>
<p>To see Old Faithful at night is,
perhaps, the most wondrous sight
of all. A giant searchlight is thrown
upon its towering plume, and the
steaming column of water, thus
caught in the vivid, white light,
presents a spectacle which becomes
an everlasting memory of your trip
to Yellowstone.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Old Faithful reaches for the clouds</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c7">Other Geysers</h3>
<p>Numerous other geysers equal or
excel Old Faithful in volume or
height, but most lack its regularity.
The Giant Geyser exceeds all others
in the amount of water expelled. Its
jet of steaming water sometimes
reaches 250 feet, and continues for
an entire hour, but it gives no advance
notice of when it will burst
forth.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Visitors examine the weird crater of Comet Geyser</i></p>
</div>
<p>Other colorful geysers include the
Beehive, Riverside, Grotto, Castle
and the Sawmill. Their descriptive
names are derived from their fantastic
and unusual formations. For
sheer individual splendor, the
Grand, Giantess and Fountain Geysers
are noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Pools and Springs</h3>
<p>When you gaze into Firehole Lake
jets of hot gas can readily be seen.
Since they look like flame, it is easy
to understand why the early trappers
called this lake &ldquo;Firehole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are other odd sights in the
basins. Fountain Paint Pot looks
like a pot of boiling paint, but it is
merely colored clay. Morning Glory
Pool is so named because of its
flower-like cone. Black Sand Pool
is a hot spring. Sapphire Springs
is accurately named. It is as blue
as the gem itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<h3 id="c9">The Continental Divide</h3>
<p>After leaving Old Faithful you
will soon come to Kepler Cascade.
Here a whole series of captivating
waterfalls descend about 150 feet,
the magic waters singing as they fall.</p>
<p>Continuing on toward Yellowstone
Lake&mdash;your next stop&mdash;you
cross the Continental Divide. The
Divide crosses the southwest corner
of the Park. This immense watershed
was created by the tablelands
of the Rocky Mountains from which
the drainage is easterly or westerly.
Eventually the flow on one slope
reaches the Atlantic Ocean, and the
flow on the other slope finds its way
to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Speedboat party on Yellowstone Lake</i></p>
</div>
<p>Yellowstone Lake covers approximately
139 square miles. Its shore
line is 100 miles long. One of the
largest mountain lakes in the world,
it is a mile and a half above sea
level. The blue of its waters against
the surrounding snow-capped mountains
makes it one of nature&rsquo;s grandest
pictures.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p13b.jpg" alt="Fishing on Yellowstone Lake" width="350" height="123" />
</div>
<p>Countless visitors spend as much
time as possible at the Lake. After
the first visit this can be readily
understood. It is ideal for camping
and fishing, and the stimulating air
at this altitude is invigorating and
delightfully refreshing.</p>
<p>You may take a pleasant boat trip
and explore its distant shores or, if
you wish, you may engage a motor- or
rowboat, at a nominal rate, for
a pleasure cruise or to try your luck
at angling. Boat trips to Stevenson
Island feature fishing, and fish-fries
on the Island.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><br /><span class="small">GRAND CANYON OF THE YELLOWSTONE</span></h2>
<p>The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone,
as seen from either Artist
Point or Inspiration Point, is one
of the truly great wonders of the
West. It is hard to conceive such
breath-taking beauty. Once you
have gazed into its jagged depths,
alive with color, you will never forget
it, nor would you if you could.</p>
<p>Perhaps you stand on the rim,
and gaze down into a seemingly
bottomless void. Eagles and fish-hawks
quite likely will be circling
far below. The sides of the ragged
pit will be painted with myriads of
shifting, changing, vivid colors, with
shades of yellow predominating. In
the bright sunlight the canyon
flames in glory. No sound comes
from the echoless, yawning gulf at
the bottom.</p>
<p>Grand Canyon&mdash;richly named!
From Artist Point it is nearly 1,600
feet to the opposite side. There is
a sheer drop of nearly 800 feet
below the platform on which you
stand. Down there lies the green,
serpentine Yellowstone River. Your
gaze follows the curve of the canyon
to where, in the distance, may be
seen the silvery sheet of the Lower
Falls plummeting downward in a
billowy cloud of misty spray.</p>
<p>You can also see the Canyon from
other angles and obtain a fuller
realization of its majestic beauty.
This may be done at Point Lookout,
or farther up, at the Grand View.</p>
<p>Time stands still at this mighty
chasm. However long you stare in
silent wonder, it seems like but a
fleeting moment.</p>
<h3 id="c12">The Upper and Lower Falls</h3>
<p>As the Yellowstone River flows
from Yellowstone Lake toward the
Missouri River and the Gulf of
Mexico, it leisurely twists and winds
through the Park until, about fifteen
miles from its source, the river
is converged to a width of less than
fifty feet. Through foaming cataracts
it suddenly rushes forward to
hurtle down 112 feet in a graceful
fall known as the Upper Falls of the
Yellowstone. The velocity of flow
is so great at the crest that the water
pours over the lip of the canyon in
a graceful arc.</p>
<p>On approaching the Grand Canyon,
a good view of the Upper Falls
may be had from an observation
point about one quarter mile below
Chittenden Bridge.</p>
<p>A short distance beyond the Upper
Falls the swift, surging torrent
again comes to a mighty precipice,
this time with a drop of 308 feet&mdash;the
famous Lower Falls. Plunging
over, it leaps downward with a
thunderous roar, and disappears in
a cloud of spray, presenting an unforgettable
picture. A third of the
fall is hidden behind this vast cloud
of spray which conceals the mad
play of the waters beneath.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Not far from Grand Canyon Hotel
is a stairway leading to the top
of the Lower Falls. It may also be
viewed from the lower end of Uncle
Tom&rsquo;s Trail which goes to the bottom
of the Canyon. Looking upward
at the roaring cataract from
that point, you are awed by its wild
and unharnessed power. Sunlight
gives additional charm to the scene
by forming multi-colored rainbows
in the filmy clouds of ascending
spray.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Tower Falls</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="Graceful Tower Falls" width="500" height="547" />
<p class="center"><i>Graceful Tower Falls</i></p>
</div>
<p>Leaving Grand Canyon, which
you do reluctantly, your route is
north to Mammoth Hot Springs.
Along the way many interesting
sights are seen. About midway between
Canyon and Mammoth you
see Tower Falls, one of the most
graceful waterfalls in the world.
Plunging 132 feet into a cavernous
basin, rimmed with stately evergreens,
the Fall gets its name from
the tower-like spires of rock that
guard the river&rsquo;s approach to the
precipice.</p>
<h3 id="c14">Mammoth Hot Springs Area</h3>
<p>From Tower Falls travelers follow
the road to Mammoth Hot
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Springs, site of the Park administration
buildings.</p>
<p>Along the sides of the hill, from
which the natural springs well, are
a group of steps or terraces over
which flow the steaming waters of
hot springs, laden with minerals.
Each descending step has been
tinted by the algae (plant life), living
in the hot water, in a thousand
tones. So vivid are these colors that
they appear to vibrate and glow in
the sunlight. Some of the older
springs have now dried up, but
about twenty are still active.</p>
<h3 id="c15">More Geysers&mdash;Norris Basin</h3>
<p>Upon leaving Mammoth Hot
Springs, on the way back to West
Yellowstone, you come upon Norris
Geyser Basin. Its geysers spout at
frequent intervals and its steam
vents noisily erupt great volumes of
vapor. Constant, Minute Man and
Whirligig are some of the geysers.
Emerald, Opal, Iris and Congress
are a few of the pools.</p>

<p><i>Bears</i> Yellowstone has long been
renowned as a refuge for wild animals.
While the visitor may not
see many animals from the highway,
the silent watcher on the trails
will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>The famous Yellowstone brown
and black bears are the ones most
frequently seen. The less-sociable
grizzlies are seldom seen.</p>
<p><b>Park regulations forbid feeding,
touching or teasing the
bears. Observe them <i>only</i> from
a safe distance.</b></p>
<h3 id="c17">Other Animals</h3>
<p>Tramping a forest trail your footsteps
may disturb a deer that
bounds away at your approach. In
some of the grassy valleys of Yellowstone
are immense herds of elk.
Bands of bighorn sheep scale the
rocky heights with amazing agility.</p>
<p>Buffalo roam the eastern section
of the Park, away from the main
roads. Quite likely you will catch
glimpses of other animals&mdash;antelope,
moose, coyote, beaver, porcupine,
squirrel and mink, some of which
are pictured here.</p>
<p>More than 200 species of birds
spend their summers in the Park.
Eagles may be seen among the crags.
Wild ducks and geese are abundant.
Many large, white swans and pelicans
lend charm to Yellowstone
Lake.</p>

<p>Grand Teton National Park became
known to white men in 1807-8
when John Colter crossed the range
on the memorable trip which resulted
in his discovery of Yellowstone.
The northern extremity of
the Park lies about 11 miles south
of Yellowstone&rsquo;s southern boundary.</p>
<p>Grand Teton National Park contains
about 96,000 acres, and is penetrated
by 90 miles of good trails.
Besides its pinnacled peaks and
majestic canyons, Grand Teton includes
five large lakes and dozens of
smaller bodies of water; glaciers,
snowfields and a green forest empire
of pine, fir and spruce. Much
of the Park is above timberline.</p>
<p>The great array of sharp, ragged
peaks, which are called the &ldquo;Teton
Range&rdquo;, present some of the grandest
mountain scenery in the world.
Southwest of Jenny Lake is a cluster
of steepled rock, the dominating
figure being Grand Teton, the famous
mountain after which the
Park is named. The towering Grand
Teton rises 13,766 feet, 7000 feet
above the floor of the valley.</p>
<p>Grand Teton National Park has
a rich history. This fertile, green
valley and lake region is the historic
&ldquo;Jackson Hole&rdquo; of pioneer days notoriety,
when it was famous as a
hideout for outlaws. A large part
of it is now included in Jackson
Hole National Monument.</p>
<p>The colorful title &ldquo;Jackson Hole&rdquo;
dates back to 1829 when Capt. Wm.
Sublette named it for a fellow trapper,
David E. Jackson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>By 1845 the romantic trapper of
the &ldquo;Fur Era&rdquo; vanished from the
Rockies, and during the next four
decades the valleys near the Tetons
were virtually deserted, except for
wandering tribes of Indians who
occasionally drifted in. Later government
expeditions making surveys
of the region named many of the
Park&rsquo;s natural beauties&mdash;Leigh, Jenny,
Taggart, Bradley and Phelps
Lakes, and Mount St. John&mdash;names
which remain today.</p>

</div>
<p>The Indian and the outlaw have
vanished from this valley but it still
retains a flavor of the thrilling
Wild West days. The colorful cowboy
on spirited pony still rides the
range, singing to the cattle, but
now he occasionally climbs into the
ranch&rsquo;s shiny station wagon and
goes over the pass to Victor to meet
and bring incoming guests to the
ranch, for here are located some of
the outstanding &ldquo;dude ranches&rdquo; of
the West.</p>
<p>For years Jackson Hole has been
famous for its big game. In this
classification the moose is the most
common in the summer. In winter
it is the home of the world&rsquo;s largest
herd of Wapiti, or American elk.
Other wild animals which inhabit
the region include bear, mule-deer,
elk, Rocky Mountain sheep, beaver,
marten, mink, weasel and coyote.
Over 100 species of birds have been
identified. A unique variety of wild
flowers and plants grow profusely
in the Tetons. The flowering period
begins in the Park as soon as the
ridges and flats are free of snow in
May and continues until about the
middle of August.</p>
<p>Grand Teton National Park is
most conveniently reached from
Victor, Idaho, on the Union Pacific
Railroad. From Victor motor buses
climb the Forest Service highway
to the top of Teton Pass. This lofty
vantage point offers a sublime view
of the surrounding domain.</p>

<p>While many of the ranches in the
Jackson Hole country are operating
cattle ranches, they do accept a few
guests during the summer months.
All have attractive, comfortable accommodations
for those who wish
to indulge in horseback riding, fishing,
mountain-climbing, hiking and
the regular activities of ranch life.
Dude ranch life offers rugged outdoor
exercise, or pleasant relaxation.
Certainly no more ideal spot
can be found for such a vacation
than in this vicinity. Most of the
ranches are located in settings of
natural beauty, with mountains,
lakes and streams near by. The hospitality
of western ranch folk is
warm and genuine.</p>

<h2 id="c34"><br /><span class="small">FOR THE CAMERA FAN</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/p38.jpg" alt="For the Camera Fan" width="500" height="266" />
</div>
<p>Yellowstone has everything for the camera
addict but the park presents some
subjects rather difficult to capture satisfactorily.</p>
<p>In either color or black and white the
geysers are best photographed with quartering
or slightly back light. Use panchromatic
film and a fairly strong yellow
filter or even a light red filter.</p>
<p>Color shots of Old Faithful are best
made very early in the morning or late
in the afternoon. If you are lucky enough
to catch a color shot of an eruption
against a sunset sky you will have a prize.</p>
<p>Hot pools demand considerable exposure
to reproduce the color in the depths
of the pool. Do not waste time on hot
pools if the day is cool and steam obscures
the subject. On such days the
geysers give their best photographic
eruptions.</p>
<p>In shooting geysers use a fast speed.
Expose for the white and let the rest of
the picture fall into a low key.</p>
<p>In using an exposure meter in Yellowstone,
be careful to see that bright
areas in the foreground do not give a
false reading.</p>
<p>Your questions regarding either still
or moving picture photography in Yellowstone
will be answered fully if you
will address Manager, Photographic Department,
Union Pacific RR, Union
Pacific Bldg., 1416 Dodge Street, Omaha
2, Nebr.</p>
<p class="tb">HAYNES PICTURE SHOPS&mdash;Pictures, albums,
guide books, postcards, camera supplies
and printing and developing service
may be had at Haynes Picture Shops
located in the hotels and lodges and elsewhere
in the Park.</p>
